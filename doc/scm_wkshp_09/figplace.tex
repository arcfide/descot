%Subject: Re:Page Make-up Challenge
%
%Maybe the following set of macros can contribute to the solution of
%the problem posed by David Rogers in TeXhax #86. It implements a floating
%insertion with the following properties:
% - Every insertion must be put in a \vbox. Customised macros can then
%   be used to place the white space for the figure and the figure caption
%   in this box.
% - The order in which these \vbox-es are inserted is maintained.
% - No more than two boxes are placed on one page: the first on the top
%   and the second on the bottom of the page.
%
%The proposed macro \figplace should create a \vbox with the correct layout
%of the figure and then call \addfigure to put it in the insertionlist:
%
%\def\figplace#1#2#3#4{setbox0=\vbox{%
%% here call macros to place figure and caption
%}
%\addfigure0}
%
%Note that the space separating the figure from the text should not
%be included in the \vbox. The skipregister \figureskip is used for this
%purpose.
%
%The macros are written in plain TeX, in fact the output routine given
%here is an extension of the plain output routine (TeX-book page 364).
%
%The basic idea is that figures that won't fit on the current page
%are kept on a list (the \box \figlist). This list is checked after
%a \shipout and if not empty a maximum of two \vboxes is inserted
%(using plains \topins) for the next page. As the insertions are \vboxes
%it is easy to split the insertion and put one at the top and one at
%the bottom of the page.
%
%Two further refinements should be mentioned here.
%1) If the figures on a page take so much room that less than a specified
%amount of space (given in dimen register \minpagesize) is left for
%the text, this text is shifted through to the next page.
%2) By inserting a \vbox with height \vsize (created by \vbox to \vsize..)
%a page insert is created. No extra \figureskip will be include in this case.
%
%I have tested these macros with real input (16 pages with on the first
%page the insertion of several figures) and it seems to work on the moment.
%However, I'm not a TeX guru and I would expect that these macros can be
%improved. One of the problems left is te fact that \addfigures must
%be called in horizontal mode ( \vadjust won't work). I would therefore
%apreciate comments, both on the macros as they stand and on how this
%contributes to the Challenge.
