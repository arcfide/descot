\abstract
The Descot packager is designed to improve the portability of code that is distributed
by Scheme programmers. Rather than define code using a specific module system that must be individually translated, into either other module systems or into Descot metadata, the Descot packager provides an easy to write encoding of the core vocabulary in the Descot metalanguage in an extensible format. Instead of writing SRDF files for each file, you define a prelude file that defines some basic defaults for a set of files, and you then define specific properties for each specific library that you have defined. This forms, in effect,a module or package declaration of the file directly using Descot. The packager can then build an SRDF file suitable for uploading to a Descot server for publication and indexing, or it can be used to general system specific modules for use by the users of the code.

For the first part Program, it contains two subparts. The first subpart is mainly about transformation from code to metadata and the second part is focused on metadata to code.
