         Tackling Library Distribution in a Chaotic Land

Scheme has seen a host of attempts to create the equivalent to CPAN 
for Scheme.  Snow is one of the more famous attempts. Others include 
CSAN, CxAN, SLIB, PlaneT, Chicken's Eggs, Bigloo Repository, and 
others. Each of these has failed to garner enough support by the 
Scheme community to make it the de facto repository of Scheme code. 
I argue that each of these has "failed" to achieve this role because 
each of them relies on a set of presumptions about library repositories 
that does not consider Scheme's diverse and chaotic nature. Instead 
of a single, authoritarian repository of code, I submit that a 
decentralized protocol that permits the coordinated sharing of the 
massively divergent code base existing in the Scheme world allows for 
all the necessary elements of library distribution, while making it 
possible to avoid restricting the use of library metadata to one 
specific frameowrk or platform. I present the preliminary elements 
of such a system -- Descot -- for feedback.  Such a system holds the 
promise of making Scheme more attractive to newcomers, as well as 
easier to use for experienced Schemers, all while facilitating the 
shared cooperation between differing repositories and library 
retrieval mechanisms.
