\chapter{Generating Web Sites with Descot}

Descot web pages are generated with the help of two procedures: 
[[write-html-page]] and [[descot-wrapper]].  The first makes 
sure that pages can be easily printed in mod\_lisp by standardizing 
the interface to using generators and a port.  The second 
performs the wrapping of all pages in the Descot headers and 
footers.

(module descot-web-generators
  (write-html-page descot-wrapper)
  (import scheme)
  (import descot-web-parameters)
  (import descot-web-utilities)
  (import sxml-to-html)

<<Wrapping>>

(xml-tags? #t)

Note that Descot web pages are written in XHTML, so we have to 
use the Chez Lib extension on Oleg's SXML, [[xml-tags?]] parameter, 
in order to ensure the right output.

\section{Writing Pages}

Descot uses mod\_lisp which normally calls a procedure with a path 
and port.  Normally, we may have a page generator that generates 
the SXML that we wish to print, but in order to print it, we 
use [[write-html-page]] to convert the SXML to XHTML and format 
it according to normal W3C standards, all sent to the given port. 

<<Writing>>=
(define (write-html-page code)
	(with-output-to-string
		(lambda ()
			(put-string (current-output-port) xhtml-decl)
			(sxml->html code))))

\section{Wrapping Pages}

Every Descot page is wrapped in a header and a footer that contains 
the navigation and search.  [[descot-wrapper]] allows this to 
be done easily, and also provides a little flexibility in the 
way of style sheets and subheadings for each page.

<<Wrapping>>=
(define descot-wrapper
  (lambda (page-name css . body-elems)
    (html 
      (head 
	(title (string-append descot-title " -- " page-name))
	(link css "stylesheet" "text/css" "screen"))
      (body
	(div '(@ (id "beta")) descot-beta-msg)
	(h1 descot-title)
	(div '(@ (id "search"))
	  (form descot-search-path "get"
	    (p 
	      (input '(name "q") '(type "text"))
	      (button '(@ (type "submit")) "Search"))))
	(if (zero? (string-length page-name)) "" (h2 page-name))
	body-elems
	(ul '(@ (id "menu"))
	  (li (a `(@ (href ,descot-about-path)) "Info"))
	  (li (a `(@ (href ,descot-blog-path)) "Blog"))
	  (li (a `(@ (href ,descot-browse-path)) "Browse"))
	  (li (a `(@ (href ,descot-search-path)) "Advanced Search"))
	  (li (a `(@ (href ,descot-submit-path)) "Submit a Library")))
	(div '(@ (id "copyright"))
	  (p 
	    "Copyright " 
	    '|&copy;| 
	    " 2009 Aaron Hsu. All rights reserved."))))))
